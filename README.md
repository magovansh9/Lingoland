# Lingoland

Lingoland is a collaborative MERN application for language learning communities

## Motivation

After developing an ever increasing interest in linguistics and learning new languages, I encountered a recurring problem:- A lack of community. Many language enthusiasts face a plateau in their learning journey due to lack of practice. 

Lingoland embraces this problem and provides a community to help with your language learning journey. Practice with fellow learners or connect with native speakers, give Lingoland a try!

## Tech Stack

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/)

### Database - MongoDB

MongoDB is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. 

### Frontend - React

React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components.

### Backend - Node JS and Express

Node JS is a fast JavaScript runtime environment that we use to build server-side applications, but it does not know how to perform serving files, handling requests, and handling HTTP methods, so this is where express js comes in.
